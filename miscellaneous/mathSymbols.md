Definitions
Element : In mathematics, an Element, or Member, of a Set is any one of the distinct objects that make up that Set. Member : Alias of Element Set : A set is a well defined collection of distinct objects. Cardinality : The number of Elements in a particular set Big O Notation : A convenient way to describe how fast a function is growing. Time Complexity : T(n)

Examples
A = {1,2,3,4}

Set A is the numbers 1,2,3,4
{1,2} is a Subset of A
B = {1,2,{3,4}}

Set B is the numbers 1,2 and the set {3,4}
x ∈ A
x is an element of A
x is a member of A
x belongs to A
x lies in A
NOTE: George Boolos strongly urged that:
contains be used for membership only
includes be used for subset relation only
NOTE: ∈ was first used by Giuseppe Peano in 1889.
A ∋ x
A contains x
x ∉ A
x is not an element of A
A ∌ x
A does not contain as a member x
Symbol chart
∈: element of
∉: not an element of
∋: contains as member
∌: does not contain as member
Cardinality of Set
The number of elements in a particular set is known as cardinality
Infinite Set
ℕ = {1,2,3,4,...}
Finite Set
A = {1,2,3,4}
Examples:
A = {1,2,3,4} B = {1,2,{3,4}} C = {red, green, blue}

2∈A
5∉A
{3,4}∈B
3∉B
4∉B
yellow∉C
